Coding

1) Find duplicate 
Given an array of integers of size n. Each number is present at least once.
You need to find and return that duplicate number present in the array.
Assume, duplicate number is always present in the array.
Sample Input:
var num = [0, 7, 2, 5, 4, 7, 1, 3, 6]
Sample Output: 7
**********************************
2) Intersection in two arrays 
Given two random integer arrays, print their intersection. 
That is, print all the elements that are present in both the given arrays.
Input arrays can contain duplicate elements.
Sample Input 1 :
var arr1 = [2, 6, 8, 5, 4, 3]
var arr2 = [2, 3, 4, 7] 
Sample Output 1 :
2 
4 
3
Sample Input 2 :
var arr1 = [2, 6, 1, 2]
var arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]
Sample Output 2 :
2 
2
1
**********************************************
3) Combinations equal to value 
Given an array of integers and given a value, find out all the pairs in the array whose sum is equal to the value 
Sample Input
var arr = [1,3, 6, 2, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4]
var pairSum = 7;
Sample Output
1 6
3 4
3 4
2 5
2 5
3 4
3 4

Javascript 

1) Write a JavaScript function to convert temperatures to and from Celsius, Fahrenheit. 

formulae: c/100 = (f-32)/180 [ where c = temperature in Celsius and f = temperature in Fahrenheit ] 

Example :
60째C is 140 째F
45째F is 7.222222222222222째C 

2) Write a function to create camelCase string from  the words  passed 
	
	Camel case means the first letter of the first word is small but the next word first letter is Capital 

	Examples of Camel Case:

	testJavascriptCode
	camelCase
	myFriendsName


Example Input/Output

     input = ['test','javascript','code'] 
     output = 'testJavascriptCode';

     ['TeST','jAvaScript', 'coDe']

3) Write a function to calculate change with items cost and cash provided
example:

items = [1,6.5,5];
cash = 20;
//return 7.5
function calculateChange(items,cash){
	
}
