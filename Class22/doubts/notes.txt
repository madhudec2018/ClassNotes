1) Using callback function or not it is working the same, why do we need cb function 


--> app.js is single file where we are handle request and response at the same file  


--> multiple files, 

customer.js --> service.js (ajax)

actors.js --> service.js (ajax)

//multiple files -- advantage and disadvantage 

//50 people 


//10 - 20 lines 


200-1000 lines 

//maintain 
// extendability (scalability ) 
// computer science is one of the complex things ever human beings has done 
// minimize 

//separation of concerns 

//reuse that 

function sum(x,y){
    //50 lines 

    return x + y;
}

var a = 10 + 5;
var b = 5 + 1;

// 1) you dont have to copy paste , as code will less it is easy to maintain 
// 2)  a bug is there, we can fix at one place 
//3) if you want to extend that function, you are extending at one place 




 call back function 

 //result 

 // function 
 //
