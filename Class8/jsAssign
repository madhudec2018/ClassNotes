/**
 * 
 1)Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to
 enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and
 depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -

totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf



where 

hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.


Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.

Input format : Basic salary & Grade (separated by space)

Output Format : Total Salary

Sample Input 1 : 10000 A

Sample Output 1 : 17600

Sample Input 2 : 4567 B

Sample Output 2 : 8762

2) Write a program to input an integer N and print the sum of all its even digits and sum of all its odd digits separately.
Digits means numbers not the places. That is, if the given integer is "13245", even digits are 2 & 4 and odd digits are 1, 3 & 5.
Input format :

 Integer N

Output format : Sum_of_Even_Digits Sum_of_Odd_Digits
(Print first even sum and then odd sum separated by space)

Sample Input : 1234

Sample Output : 6 4

3) Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.

Input format : Two integers x and n (separated by space)

Output Format : x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)

Sample Input 1 : 3 4

Sample Output 1 : 81

Sample Input 2 : 2 5

Sample Output 2 : 32
